**Date:** 2025-11-13
**Purpose:** Visual comparison showing quality improvements

---

## Example 1: Scenario 831 - Eating Out Causes Anxiety and Isolation

### BEFORE (Repetitive Pattern)
```
1. Take time to research menu ahead, ensuring you understand the full context and implications

2. Take time to call venue, ensuring you understand the full context and implications

3. Take time to suggest restaurant choice, ensuring you understand the full context and implications

4. Take time to eat beforehand if needed, ensuring you understand the full context and implications

5. Take time to practice flexibility, ensuring you understand the full context and implications
```

**Problems:**
- Generic "Take time to..." on every step
- Repetitive suffix on every step
- Vague actions (no specifics on HOW to do it)
- No timeframes, quantities, or measurable criteria
- All steps start identically (monotonous structure)

### AFTER (Improved)
```
1. Check restaurant menus online before accepting invitations to identify safe options
   that align with your dietary needs.

2. Call the restaurant during off-peak hours to ask about ingredient lists,
   preparation methods, or possible accommodations.

3. When friends plan outings, volunteer to suggest a restaurant you've researched,
   framing it as your treat or enthusiasm to share a new spot.

4. Eat a small, satisfying snack before going out so hunger doesn't pressure you
   into uncomfortable choices.

5. Choose one menu item outside your usual comfort zone each month to gradually
   build confidence and reduce food-related anxiety.
```

**Improvements:**
- Specific actions (check menus, call restaurant, suggest spot)
- Timeframes (off-peak hours, each month)
- Measurable criteria (identify safe options, one menu item)
- Varied sentence structure
- Contextually relevant details (framing suggestion as treat)

**Word Count:** Before: 25-30 words/step → After: 20-40 words/step
**Actionability:** Before: Low → After: High

## Example 2: Scenario 1139 - Exam Pressure and Fear of Disappointing Others

### BEFORE (Fragmented)
```
1. Create a realistic study plan to reduce overwhelm.

2. Take time to focus on learning, ensuring you understand the full context and implications

3. Take time to not perfection., ensuring you understand the full context and implications

4. Take time to practice self-care through rest, ensuring you understand the full context and implications

5. Take time to food, ensuring you understand the full context and implications

6. Take time to and faith., ensuring you understand the full context and implications

7. Surrender anxiety through prayer or breathing exercises.
```

**Problems:**
- Step 1: Good, but too short
- Steps 2-6: All have "Take time to..." prefix
- Step 3: Fragment ("not perfection.")
- Step 5: Single word fragment ("food")
- Step 6: Nonsensical fragment ("and faith.")
- 7 steps instead of standard 5
- Inconsistent quality across steps

### AFTER (Fixed)
```
1. Break study material into daily 2-hour blocks with specific topics, creating
   achievable goals rather than vague 'study everything' plans.

2. Focus on understanding core concepts through active recall and practice problems,
   not memorizing every detail perfectly.

3. Schedule daily 30-minute breaks for walks, stretching, or breathing exercises
   to prevent burnout and maintain mental clarity.

4. Eat balanced meals at regular times and get 7-8 hours of sleep nightly, even
   during exam week, to optimize cognitive performance.

5. Write down three things within your control each morning (study time, rest, effort)
   and consciously release attachment to outcomes through prayer or meditation.
```

**Improvements:**
- All fragments removed and integrated properly
- Consistent 5-step structure
- Specific timeframes (2-hour blocks, 30-minute breaks, 7-8 hours sleep)
- Measurable actions (three things within control)
- Logical progression: Plan → Learn → Rest → Care → Mindset
- No repetitive prefixes or suffixes

**Word Count:** Before: Varies 3-30 words/step → After: 25-35 words/step
**Completeness:** Before: 3/7 steps were fragments → After: 5/5 complete

   and implications

2. Take time to reframe as personal choice, ensuring you understand the full context
   and implications

3. Take time to avoid unsolicited advice, ensuring you understand the full context
   and implications

4. Take time to ask others about favourites, ensuring you understand the full context
   and implications

5. Take time to celebrate diversity, ensuring you understand the full context
   and implications
```

**Problems:**
- Identical structure on all 5 steps
- Generic advice ("notice thoughts," "reframe," "celebrate")
- No specific actions or examples
- Templated feel, not personalized to scenario
- Missing HOW to do these things

### AFTER (Improved)
```
1. When you notice judgmental thoughts about others' food choices, pause and remind
   yourself that your diet is a personal preference, not a moral standard.

2. Reframe your eating habits as a choice that works for you rather than a superior
   lifestyle everyone should follow.

3. Practice refraining from giving unsolicited nutrition advice, even when asked
   casually, unless someone specifically requests your guidance.

4. Ask people about their favorite foods or family recipes with genuine curiosity,
   focusing on enjoyment rather than nutritional value.

5. Appreciate the diversity of food cultures and individual circumstances that
   shape people's diets differently from yours.
```

**Improvements:**
- Specific triggers (when you notice judgmental thoughts)
- Concrete actions (pause and remind, refrain from advice, ask about favorites)
- Practical examples (family recipes, genuine curiosity)
- Contextual details (unless specifically requested)
- Mindset shift (enjoyment vs nutritional value)

**Word Count:** Before: 20-25 words/step → After: 22-32 words/step
**Specificity:** Before: Generic → After: Scenario-specific

   context and implications

4. Take time to expand your professional network, ensuring you understand the
   full context and implications

5. Take time to build emergency savings where possible, ensuring you understand
   the full context and implications
```

**Problems:**
- Same prefix and suffix on all steps
- Lacks specific HOW-TO guidance
- No timeframes or measurable criteria
- Missing practical implementation details

### AFTER (Improved)
```
1. Refuse to participate in rumor-spreading conversations; instead, redirect focus
   to your current work and deliverables.

2. Document your recent achievements and contributions in a private file to reference
   during performance reviews or job searches.

3. Discreetly update your resume, LinkedIn profile, and portfolio to be ready for
   opportunities if layoffs do occur.

4. Attend industry networking events or reach out to former colleagues to expand
   your professional connections proactively.

5. Set aside a portion of each paycheck into an emergency fund if possible, aiming
   for 3-6 months of living expenses as a financial buffer.
```

**Improvements:**
- Concrete behaviors (refuse, document, update, attend, set aside)
- Specific targets (resume + LinkedIn + portfolio)
- Measurable goals (3-6 months expenses)
- Actionable details (reach out to former colleagues, networking events)
- Professional tone appropriate for workplace scenario

**Word Count:** Before: 18-24 words/step → After: 20-30 words/step
**Actionability:** Before: Medium → After: High

## Example 5: Scenario 874 - Body Dysmorphia Triggers from Gym Mirrors

### BEFORE (Repetitive Pattern)
```
1. Take time to choose mirror-free spaces, ensuring you understand the full
   context and implications

2. Take time to cover mirrors where possible, ensuring you understand the full
   context and implications

3. Take time to focus on feeling in body, ensuring you understand the full
   context and implications

4. Take time to workout outdoors, ensuring you understand the full context
   and implications

5. Take time to use affirmations, ensuring you understand the full context
   and implications
```

**Problems:**
- Repetitive structure lacks variety
- "Feeling in body" is grammatically awkward
- No specific guidance on implementing affirmations
- Missing practical details about outdoor workouts

### AFTER (Improved)
```
1. Request a tour of local gyms to find one with minimal mirrors or sections
   where you can work out without constant reflection.

2. Position yourself facing away from mirrors during workouts, or use equipment
   in corners or against walls.

3. Shift your focus to physical sensations during exercise—muscle engagement,
   breathing rhythm, heart rate—rather than visual appearance.

4. Plan outdoor workouts like hiking, cycling, or running in nature to completely
   remove mirror exposure while staying active.

5. Develop a pre-workout affirmation routine focusing on what your body can do
   ("I am building strength," "My body supports me") rather than how it looks.
```

**Improvements:**
- Specific locations (corners, against walls, local gyms)
- Concrete alternatives (hiking, cycling, running)
- Example affirmations ("I am building strength")
- Sensory details (muscle engagement, breathing rhythm)
- Actionable first steps (request tour, plan workouts)
