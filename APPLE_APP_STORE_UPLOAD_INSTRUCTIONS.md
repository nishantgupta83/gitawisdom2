## üîç Troubleshooting

2. Find your build ‚Üí Click "Manage Compliance"
3. Select "Yes" for encryption
4. Select "No" for encryption exemption (standard HTTPS)
5. Save

### ‚ùå Error: "Invalid Bundle - Missing Privacy Manifest"

**Solution**: Already included! Your app has `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` in the build.

### ‚ùå Error: "ITMS-90034: Missing or invalid signature"

**Solution**: Rebuild IPA with proper distribution certificate:
1. Ensure you have "Apple Distribution" certificate (not "Apple Development")
2. Rebuild with: `flutter build ipa --release`

### ‚ùå Upload stuck at "Uploading..."

**Solution**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Try Method 2 (command line) instead
3. Ensure IPA file isn't corrupted: `ls -lh build/ios/ipa/GitaWisdom.ipa`
