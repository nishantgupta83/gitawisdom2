6. Expand supabase_auth_service_test.dart (40-50 tests)
7. Expand semantic_search_service_test.dart (15-20 tests)
8. Expand journal_service_test.dart (20-25 tests)

Medium-term (Boost coverage):
9. Expand scenario_service_test.dart (10-15 tests)
10. Expand background_music_service_test.dart (8-10 tests)
11. Expand search_service_test.dart (10-15 tests)

Long-term (Final push):
12. Add comprehensive model tests
13. Expand widget test coverage
14. Add integration tests
15. Achieve 70% coverage goal

ESTIMATED TIMELINE:
-------------------

Phase 1 (Fix existing):    4-6 hours   → 49.41% coverage
