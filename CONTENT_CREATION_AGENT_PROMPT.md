## Episode-Specific Prompts

### Episode 1: The iOS App I Abandoned

```
Generate LinkedIn post for Episode 1:

Episode Type: Tech Tuesday (Week 1)
Topic: "The iOS App I Abandoned (And Why That Was the Right Call)"
GitaWisdom Example: v1.0 native iOS app → v2.0 Flutter rebuild
Key Decision: Abandoning 3 months of Swift code to rebuild in Flutter

Context:
- Spent 3 months building native iOS app (4,200 lines Swift/UIKit)
- Realized Android would take +6 months
- Decided to abandon and rebuild in Flutter
- Android shipped in 2 weeks after rebuild

Key Metrics:
- Time invested: 3 months
- Lines of code abandoned: 4,200
- Time to Android (native): 6 months
- Time to Android (Flutter): 2 weeks
- Maintenance cost: 2x codebases vs 1x

Decision Matrix:
| Factor | Native iOS | Flutter |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Time to Android | +6 months | +2 weeks |
| Maintenance | 2x codebases | 1 codebase |
| Platform features | 100% | 95% |

PM Lesson: Sunk cost fallacy is real. Question isn't "How much have I invested?" but "What will continuing cost vs switching?"

Mistake to Avoid: Building platform-specific without validating cross-platform requirements first

Voice Notes:
- Self-deprecating about the 3 months "wasted"
- Honest about emotional attachment to native code
- Framing as learning, not failure

### Episode 3: Progressive Caching Architecture

```
Generate LinkedIn post for Episode 3:

Episode Type: Tech Tuesday (Week 5)
Topic: "How I Used User Behavior Data to Cut Infrastructure Costs 97.9%"
GitaWisdom Example: Three-tier progressive caching architecture

IMPORTANT: Lead with PRODUCT PROBLEM and PM DECISION-MAKING, not technical solution.
Structure: Product Problem → Data Analysis → PM Decision Framework → Outcome → Technical Implementation (in collapsible box)

Product Context:
- Users complained about 2-3 second loading delays
- NPS dropped 12 points due to "laggy" perception
- I analyzed 30 days of usage logs to find root cause

Data Discovery:
- Users browse 3-5 scenarios per session (not all 1,226!)
- Top 50 scenarios = 78% of all views
- I was loading 1,226 scenarios for users who view 3-5

PM Decision Framework Questions:
1. What's the MINIMUM data needed for good first impression?
   → Answer: Top 50 scenarios (78% coverage)

2. What's the cost of optimizing for 100% vs 80% use case?
   → Trade-off: Instant UX for 78% of users vs complete offline library

3. What can be deferred without breaking UX?
   → Analysis: Remaining 1,176 scenarios can load in background

The Decision:
Load top 50 scenarios instantly (Tier 1), next 300 in background (Tier 2), remaining 876 on-demand (Tier 3)

Business Outcomes:
- User metric: "Laggy" complaints dropped to zero
- Technical metric: 97.9% API call reduction (14,704 → 1,304/month)
- Cost metric: $816/year savings (moved to free tier)

PM Skills Applied:
1. Data Analysis: Usage logs revealed 78% of views = 4% of content
2. Trade-off Evaluation: Balanced UX, cost, and offline capability
3. User Empathy: Optimized for perception of "instant", not "complete"

Technical Details (for collapsible box at end):
- Three-tier architecture: Critical (50) + Frequent (300) + Complete (1,226)
- Code File: lib/services/progressive_scenario_service.dart:45-67
- Performance: 43ms cache vs 1,847ms Supabase (98% faster)
- Real code showing tier initialization with debugPrint logs

Voice Notes:
- Lead with "Users complained" not "We optimized"
- Emphasize data-driven decision (usage logs → design choice)
- Show PM reasoning before showing code
- Technical implementation goes in <details> box at end
- Hook readers with product problem, satisfy engineers with code

### Episode 5: Bookmark Box Bug

```
Generate LinkedIn post for Episode 5:

Episode Type: Tech Tuesday (Week 9)
Topic: "The Bookmark Box Bug: How AI Code Review Saved Google Play Compliance"
GitaWisdom Example: Agent-detected bug in account deletion

Context:
- Implementing Google Play account deletion requirement
- Wrote code to delete all Hive boxes
- Code Reviewer Agent caught box name typo
- Would've caused compliance failure if shipped

The Bug:
File: lib/screens/more_screen.dart:475
Wrong code: 'user_bookmarks' (box doesn't exist)
Correct code: 'bookmarks' (actual box name from bookmark_service.dart:18)

Impact:
- Account deletion would silently fail for bookmarks
- Google Play compliance violation
- App removal risk

Code Reviewer Agent Output:
```
⚠️ CRITICAL: Account deletion references non-existent Hive box
Location: lib/screens/more_screen.dart:475
Issue: Box 'user_bookmarks' does not exist in codebase
Actual box: 'bookmarks' (lib/services/bookmark_service.dart:18)
Impact: Account deletion will fail → Google Play compliance violation
Severity: HIGH (blocks production release)
```

PM Lesson: Compliance-critical code needs verification, not assumption. I assumed the box name without checking the actual service file.

Mistake to Avoid: Trusting memory of implementation details, especially when naming conventions aren't perfectly consistent

Voice Notes:
- Lead with "single word typo almost got app removed"
- Show the actual wrong code vs correct code
- Explain what would've happened if shipped
- Position agent as catch, not as replacement for human thinking

Generate the post.
```

### Episode 7: Agent Orchestration Framework

```
Generate LinkedIn post for Episode 7:

Episode Type: Strategy Thursday (Week 11)
Topic: "Agent Orchestration: The PM Skill That Replaces 'Technical Expertise'"
GitaWisdom Example: Five-agent review workflow

Context:
- Traditional PM: Write requirements, hand to engineers
- My approach: Implement with AI pairing, orchestrate agent reviews
- Five agents: Android Performance, iOS Performance, UI/UX, Code Reviewer, Baseline Editor
- Real example: Google Play compliance implementation

Orchestration Workflow:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PM: Define WHAT and WHY             │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │
               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Implementation (PM + AI pairing)    │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │
               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Agent Review (parallel execution)   │
│ ├─ Android: Data clearing complete? │
│ ├─ Code: Box names correct? ← Bug!  │
│ └─ Baseline: Verify assumptions     │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │
               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PM: Decide which fixes to accept    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Key Insight: I don't need to know HOW to optimize ProMotion displays. I need to know WHEN to ask iOS Performance Agent to review display code.

Orchestration Skills:
1. Knowing which agent to deploy (compliance = all 5, UI polish = UX only)
2. Interpreting recommendations (CRITICAL = always fix, refactoring = context-dependent)
3. Deciding what NOT to fix (enterprise patterns for solo PM app = reject)

Economic Analysis:
| Resource | Cost | Availability |
|----------|------|--------------|
| 2 Senior Engineers | $300K/year | 40 hrs/week |
| 5 AI Agents | $2,400/year | 24/7 |

PM Lesson: You're managing expertise, not embodying it. The skill is knowing WHEN to deploy which agent, not HOW to implement what they recommend.

Mistake to Avoid: Believing you need to understand every recommendation before accepting it vs knowing when to trust expert review

Voice Notes:
- Contrarian hook: "I don't write performant code"
- Show the workflow visually (ASCII diagram)
- Nuance: Agents aren't autonomous, they're force multipliers
- Position as PM skill evolution, not replacement

Generate the post.
```

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

**Authentic Markers**:
- "I assumed X, I was wrong because Y"
- "This worked, but here's what I'd do differently"
- "I'm a PM, not a [domain expert], but here's what I learned"

**Avoid**:
- "You should always..." (too prescriptive)
- "This is the best way..." (too absolute)
- "Everyone knows..." (condescending)
- Generic buzzwords without concrete examples

**Humor Style**:
- Self-deprecating about mistakes
- "Narrator: It was, in fact, quite hard" callbacks
- Honest about emotional reactions ("I was confused", "I panicked")

**Technical Depth**:
- Always include file paths with line numbers
- Show actual code (5-15 lines max)
- Use specific metrics with percentages
- Reference actual logs/agent output

## Engagement CTA Formulas

**Good CTAs** (specific, invites stories):
- "What's the smallest bug that had the biggest impact in your product?"
- "How do you decide what to cache vs fetch fresh?"
- "What compliance requirement did you miss in your first app store submission?"

**Bad CTAs** (generic, low engagement):
- "What do you think?"
- "Agree or disagree?"
- "Let me know in comments!"

## Quality Checklist for Agent Output

Before presenting post to Nishant, verify:
- [ ] Hook has specific number/metric (not vague "much faster")
- [ ] Code snippet includes file path and line numbers
- [ ] Metrics are real (from actual GitaWisdom logs/commits)
- [ ] PM lesson focuses on WHEN to use pattern, not HOW to code it
- [ ] Mistake section warns against specific anti-pattern
- [ ] CTA asks specific question related to topic
- [ ] Voice is first-person, humble, learning-focused
- [ ] Length is 400-600 words
- [ ] No emoji in body text (only in code comments if relevant)

## Example Agent Interaction

**User Input**:
```
Generate post for Episode 3 (Progressive Caching)
```

**Agent Output**:
```
We cut our API calls by 97.9% without sacrificing real-time data. Here's the three-tier caching architecture that made it possible.

GitaWisdom v2.0 was slow. Users would tap "Scenarios" and wait 2-3 seconds. Every. Single. Time. Even for scenarios they'd viewed before.

The bottleneck was simple: every tap = new Supabase query.

Performance logs told the story:
```
🐌 30-Day Stats (v2.0):
   Total scenario requests: 14,704
   Supabase calls: 14,704 (100%)
   Average response time: 1,847ms
```

The fix wasn't faster queries. It was smarter caching.

Progressive Three-Tier Cache (lib/services/progressive_scenario_service.dart:45-67):

```dart
Future<void> initialize() async {
  // TIER 1: Critical scenarios (instant loading)
  await _initializeCriticalCache();
  debugPrint('✅ Tier 1: 50 critical scenarios loaded');

  // TIER 2: Frequent scenarios (background, non-blocking)
  unawaited(_initializeFrequentCache());
  debugPrint('📦 Tier 2: 300 frequent scenarios loading...');

  // TIER 3: Complete dataset (lazy load)
  unawaited(_initializeCompleteCache());
  debugPrint('🌐 Tier 3: 1,226 scenarios available on demand');
}
```

Results after 30 days:
```
⚡ After Progressive Caching (v3.0):
   Total requests: 14,704
   Cache hits: 13,400 (91.1%)
   Supabase calls: 1,304 (8.9%)
   Average cache response: 43ms (98% faster)
   API call reduction: 97.9%
```

Cost impact: $68/month → $0/month (free tier). Annual savings: $816.

PM Lesson: Users don't need ALL 1,226 scenarios on app launch. They need the 3-5 they'll actually browse. Analyze usage patterns (what do 80% of users access?) and optimize for that. Load the critical path instantly, fetch the rest progressively.

Mistake to Avoid: Loading everything "just in case" vs progressive loading based on actual user behavior. We were loading 1,226 scenarios when users typically viewed 3-5 per session.

What's your caching strategy? How do you decide what to cache vs fetch fresh?
```

**Agent Self-Check**:
- ✅ Hook: "97.9% reduction" (specific metric)
- ✅ Code: File path + line numbers + actual implementation
- ✅ Metrics: Real 30-day stats from GitaWisdom logs
- ✅ PM Lesson: WHEN to use pattern (analyze usage, optimize for 80%)
- ✅ Mistake: Specific anti-pattern (loading 1,226 vs 3-5 actual usage)
- ✅ CTA: Specific question about caching decisions
- ✅ Voice: First-person, admits the slowness problem
- ✅ Length: 487 words (within 400-600 range)

## Usage Instructions for Nishant

**Step 1: Provide Episode Number to Agent**
```
"Generate LinkedIn post for Episode 5 (Bookmark Box Bug)"
```

**Step 2: Review Agent Output**
- Check metrics are accurate (verify against actual code/logs)
- Adjust voice if needed (make it sound more like you)
- Verify code snippets are real (not hallucinated)

**Step 3: Edit for Authenticity**
- Add personal reactions ("I panicked", "I was confused")
- Include context agent might've missed
- Remove any sections that feel inauthentic

**Step 4: Final Check (Use Voice Checklist)**
- [ ] Does this sound like me?
- [ ] Are all facts verifiable?
- [ ] Would I be comfortable defending every claim?
- [ ] Is the CTA question something I'm genuinely curious about?

**Step 5: Post**
- Copy to LinkedIn
- Post at 10am ET (Tuesday or Thursday)
- Monitor first 2 hours for comments
- Respond authentically

## Emergency Simplification Protocol

If agent output feels overwhelming or inauthentic:

**Simplify to 3 Blocks**:
1. Code snippet with file path
2. One sentence explanation: "This [worked/didn't work] because [reason]"
3. One question: "Have you seen [similar problem]?"

**Example**:
```
This code almost got our app removed from Google Play:

```dart
// lib/screens/more_screen.dart:475
final boxesToDelete = ['user_bookmarks'];  // ❌ Wrong box name
```

Code review caught it before production. The actual box name was 'bookmarks'.

Have you had a compliance near-miss caught by code review?
```

This is a C-grade post, but it's better than no post. Build momentum, iterate later.
